RED PLANET Pi v1.0 (C) 2015/2023
================================                
  for Raspberry Pi / Windows *

*compatible with systems that support Python/Pygame



Lead our hero into the underground of the old space station to blow up the entire complex and wipe out its evil inhabitants.
But beware, the environment is dangerous. Avoid coming into contact with the aliens, and avoid falling into the lava or radioactive waste pits.


ITEMS
=====

EXPLOSIVE: To successfully complete the mission you must obtain the 15 explosives scattered around the station, and place them in the explosives depot, deep inside the Martian base.
Once deposited, you must return to the control centre and activate the detonator.

KEY CARD: Sometimes you will have to access locked areas with access cards, so you will have to locate these cards before you can continue your mission.

GATE: You will only be able to open them if you have a card. 
The cards are for single use only, but the door will remain open.

AMMO: You have the possibility to fire plasma bullets at your enemies, but be careful not to waste ammunition, which is scarce.
There are reloads scattered throughout the complex.

OXYGEN: Keep an eye on the condition of your oxygen cylinders and find new ones before they run out or you will die on the spot.

DISKETTE: Saves the current game situation to continue the game at another time.
You will be able to locate them on the screens where there were previously cards. 

BURGUER, CAKE, DONUT: Yes, Martians like them too. 
Eat them if you want to see your score go up.


ENEMIES
=======

INFECTED: Previous companions who attempted the mission and failed. 
The bite of the arachnoviruses keeps them in an undead state.
They move in a linear fashion and can be very fast. 
Take them out before they infect you.

ARACHNOVIRUS/PELUSOID: Erratic and fast moving.
They usually move through the air. 
They are the most numerous aliens that have colonised the base.

FANTY: They are very intelligent. They can lie low and wait for your arrival.
If they see or hear you, they will pounce on you. 
In that case, finish them off as soon as possible.

TIPS AND TRICKS
===============

- Reserve some ammunition and oxygen for when you have placed the explosives and returned to the control centre.
In the event of an oxygen shortage, an alarm will sound during which the priority is to search for new cylinders.

- Use extreme caution in the vertical corridors. These are the most treacherous areas.

- Whenever possible, it is best not to disturb the FANTYS.

- Use the save game when the game situation is appropriate, i.e. with enough lives and oxygen to finish the game.
Remember that selecting a DISKETTE overwrites the previous game.

- To place the explosives in their final location and to use the detonator, press the ACTION key (below), otherwise nothing will happen.

AUTHOR'S NOTE
=============

This project was programmed entirely on Raspberry Pi computers and Python language, thinking about the large number of academies and users who use these computers around the world to learn computer science and programming.
If any of these students or casual gamers, access the source code to study it, improve it, make their own game, or simply review and understand it, then it will have been worth the effort.
